# NOTE, THIS IS MY OWN RESEARCH BECAUSE THE SORTED METHOD WASNT EXPLAINED AND SOLVING THE PROBLEMS
# I REALIZE THAT THIS METHOD COULD MAKE MY CODING MORE EASY AND PERFORMANT
# with sorted you cant sort a list that contains numerical and alphabetical numbers
# sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=reverse), reserve is a boolean, false will sort ascending
# True will sort descending, default is false
# key is a function to execute to decide the order
def last(a):
    # this would make that every tuple would have associated the last item to them
    return a[-1]
# and organize it using the last item as a reference
# e.g. [(1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (2, 2)] yields


def sort_last(tuples):
    # order this having the last element of the tuple in count
    return sorted(tuples, key=last)
# [(2,2),(1,3),(3,4,5),(1,7)]


# sort descending

strs = ['a', 'aa', 'a', 'aaa', 'wxscs']

# then the elements are sorted acording to their "proxy value" associated
